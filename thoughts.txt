reserch the problem so I have an understanding of the problem better


wirte to pawl, maybe he has some background knowleage


check if sorts are different in the given data


can we split into different sorts, that might improve results


might prove that they have some importent


learn structure in images using autoencoders


deeplearning book autoendocers


check references around 27


check if lightning is consistent


is colors important, or just use grayscale


check average size of the broken circles, to find a fixed size


statistics on the size, histogram ect. - done


make sure keras can use pretraining of models - done


how to pretrain, get imagenet - done


lituerre review
What has other people done when we have few training examples, pretraining data arugmentation ect.



to start
windows within region of interrest - done


data arugmentation by shifting in different - done


make test set later

---

try fewer layers and filters


hard negative example training


jet filter learning


NIN, train og parameters, topo and all the tricks


ensable learning


initializing tricks


lenet 5



What has other people done when we have few training examples, pretraining data arugmentation ect -


try with grayscale -


figure out optimizers and weight initalizations


hard negative training DO IT


ensamble learning


hyper parameter patch size


Auto encoders DTU ref 30


Check lightning difference between images




--------


Autoencoders with convolution


Sharing weights, with rgb input is 3d, produces 2d, for each filter, thus sharing weights are difficult, since the input and output of layers are different.

Look at cnn slide for back propergate back through network, to visualize optimal features.
